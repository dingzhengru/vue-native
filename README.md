# Vue Native

## What is Vue Native?
Vue Native is a mobile framework to build truly native mobile app using Vue.js.  
Its is designed to connect React Native and Vue.js.  
Vue Native is a wrapper around React Native APIs, which allows you to use Vue.js and compose rich mobile User Interface.  

**Vue Native 依賴於 React Native，實際上，所有的.vue文件都會編譯成以.js後綴的React Native組件**
